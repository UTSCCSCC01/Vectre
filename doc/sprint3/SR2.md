- Henry
- Nikhil
- Peter W.

## Unfinished Tasks
None!

## Practices To Continue Using 
- Frequent and productive standups allows everyone to know what is going on with all parts of the project
- Pair programming on some tasks improved code quality and lowered bugs
## New Practices To Use
- Creating necessary documentation on a rolling basis

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using
- Avoid cramming near the end of the sprint; start harder tasks earlier since they produce the most amount of bugs later on

## Best Experiences 
- Exposure to new and industry-level technologies/practices
- Connecting parts of the frontend to the backend and seeing the whole project come together 

## Worst Experiences 
- Working with Redux, was very confusing
- Balancing time for this project and midterms that were going on at the time
