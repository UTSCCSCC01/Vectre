# Sprint 2 Planning Meeting
___
On the 5th of July, 2022, we held our sprint 3 Planning meeting on Discord with the goal of identifying the unfinished tasks and our overall theme for the sprint. Our agenda consisted of deciding which new user stories should be considered, indentifying the related tasks to the user stories, and distributing the tasks among the team members. All member of Vectre Labs were present during this meeting.

We agreed on having community and post feeds as our main theme for the sprint, and chose five user stories that would implement features related to the theme. These features enable users to see their profile, create, join, make post to communties, and see posts in their personal feeds and community feeds with the ability to sort those posts . We then break down the user stories to subtasks, evaluate the subtasks using plannig poker, and distribute them along with document responsibilities among our members.
