# Sprint 4 Planning Meeting
___
On the 17th of July, 2022, we held our sprint 4 Planning meeting on Discord with the goal of identifying the last few user stories of the project and their related tasks. We then equally distributed the tasks among the team members. All member of Vectre Labs were present during this meeting.

For the final sprint, we aim to implement features for our existing components to finalise the product. We decided on features that enable users to browse through all communities and look at weekly trending communities, allow NFT owners to use their NFTs as their avatar, allow Community moderators to moderate community posts and members, and allow users to search for posts across the site. We then break down the user stories to subtasks, evaluate the subtasks using plannig poker, and distribute them along with document responsibilities among our members.
