# Summary 
## Project Objective
Vectre is a native web3 social platform, an all-in-one social media built for community management and token-gated communities. The web application will allow users to connect their Metamask wallet and showcase their NFTs through an NFT dashboard, communicate with community members with NFT holders of the same collection as well as enable community leaders to foster controlled interactions within their community, by democratically setting community guidelines through ‘proposals’.

## Key Users/Personas
Sture Kranz: a 26 year old programmer with a keen interest in NFT trading. Sture regularly uses social media such as Twitter regularly to keep in touch with the NFT community and to discover potential NFTs to invest into. Currently, Sture has built up a reputable NFT portfolio and wants to share his collection with his friends and other verified owners of NFTs.

Jeffrey Joyner: a 35 year old who has worked on numerous cryptocurrency projects and founded an NFT project, Sketchings. Sketchings has been steadily gaining popularity and Jeffrey would like to engage with members of the Sketchings community and have their voices matter in discussions.

## Key Scenarios
Through a lot of hours spent trading, Sture’s NFT collection contains some NFTs worth millions of dollars. Sture has been using Twitter to take part in discussions in the NFT community and has even uploaded some of his NFT artworks as his Twitter profile picture! However, Sture frequently comes across other Twitter users that dishonestly claim his NFT to be theirs.

With the rise in popularity of his NFT project Sketchings, Jeffrey has also had to deal with a lot more misinformation in his community. Recently, Jeffrey has been accused of using artwork for Sketchings without the artist’s permission (usually by people outside of the Sketchings community). While Jeffrey tries to address misinformation such as this as soon as he comes across them, he cannot always keep up effectively with the current events in his community.

## Key Principles

Community: To connect community members into a single platform through verified digital assets (proving ownership and membership within the community), as well as to enable new members to explore different communities and find a community fit for them. 

Accessibility: To ensure all information that the community leaders want to share can be found with ease and are able to prevent the spread of misinformation within the web3 community. 

Design: To design a web application that is modern and intuitive to encourage the use of Vectre and onboard others onto the social platform with minimal to no resistance.
