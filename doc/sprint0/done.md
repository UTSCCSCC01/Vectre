# Done
Our definition of a feature implementation being “done” is:
- Associated user story for the feature is completely fulfilled. 
- All features work as intended and have been tested for bugs & regressions 
- All identified bugs have been resolved 
- Components of the feature are documented thoroughly 
- Before merging into the `main` branch, the product owner and two team members must approve the feature’s associated code
