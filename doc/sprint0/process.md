## Reflect on how your team worked together.
Our group worked together in harmony by organizing the group meetings after Sprint 0 was released. Our group ensured to have 3 meetings scheduled per week at 9 pm, to maintain the right momentum to build on the project at hand, and accommodate different members with different commitments and priorities. During the start of each meeting, each member would provide updates regarding their work so far from the requirements of the sprint assigned.

## How did you organise the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
Our main method of contact and communication was our internal Discord server, such that team members posted updates within particular text channels and can actively ask questions and discuss doubts for any assignments where further discussion was necessary. Additionally, Piazza and the CSCC01 discord server were used for any doubts that were unanswered and to communicate with the TAs/Instructors directly.

## How did you make decisions?
During team discussions, all members of the team were welcomed to contribute their ideas for parts of the project. However, before important decisions were made, the team would discuss each new idea and their strengths. Since there were members of the team with more experience in a certain field, it was helpful to bring everyone to the same page and a decision was made after everyone came to a mutual agreement.

## How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?
We defined the priority of user stories by the value it provides to the overall product and to the target user of the story. Generally, features that are close to the core functionality of Vectre were ranked higher than others.

## How frequently did you meet?
The team met every 2-3 days on the Vectre Labs Discord server where we updated each other regarding the progress status of each memberâ€™s individual tasks.

## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
With frequent meetings between team members, we noticed that team members were much more engaged with various parts of the project, even if that task was not theirs directly. Moving forward, we want to keep this attitude of every member being an owner of the project and taking initiative outside of their regular tasks. With more engaging discussions, we want to build a network of trust between members so that we may help one another wherever possible and even give someone the confidence to disagree on decisions if they decide against them. We believe this will allow the team to deliver results of much higher quality.
