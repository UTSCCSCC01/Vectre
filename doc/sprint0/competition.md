Vectre is an all-in-one web3 social platform, allowing users to connect their Metamask wallet within our platform, showcase their NFTs on a personal dashboard, communicate directly with holders of specific NFT collections, and enables leaders to foster productive community interactions with a fair set of guidelines. Furthermore, Vectre ensures that the true ownership of digital assets is maintained and are appropriately indicated to prevent fraud. 

Twetch (https://twetch.com) is a pay-to-earn social platform like twitter, but content creators can earn income from creating content in the form of NFTs. This rewarding system will keep the social platform interactive at the same time as it is kept peer to peer. This is similar to our app in the way that it rewards its content creators. However, Twetch is an on-chain social network, which means that for each post a user creates, a gas fee must be spent in order to bring the post onto the network. This is unfeasible in the long term, since users do not wish to spend money when interacting with others, by which Vectre allows for.  

Aether (https://getaether.net/) is also a decentralized forum, more similar to Reddit, in which people can join/create different communities, post text-based contents in the communities, and like/dislike othersâ€™ posts. There is no centralized server that stores the data/runs the app, users are completely peer to peer. Users can also vote on moderators that manage the community, which allows the communities to be run much more democratically. However, Aether lacks the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) integration by which Vectre allows for and uniquely identifies itself by. 

Mastodon (https://joinmastodon.org/) is another decentralized social network, however focuses its model based upon privacy, a community-owned, ad-free social network. Mastodon, however, does not create any focus upon web3 communities, and does not allow for community leaders to be able to accurately and effectively communicate with their members as well as the lack of NFT integration. 

The key difference between these social platforms and Vectre is that these social platforms are truly decentralized, while being able to perform certain functionalities. Vectre on the other hand, is a web3 social platform, by which we provide a space for web3 communities to thrive and shape the direction of their project. Our app will target the users who are interested in a thorough and immersive Web3 experience that allows users to create and join the communities like in Twetch, but can vote on the rules in that community like in Aether, but provide additional features such as NFT dashboards. In our case, we want to provide an all-in-one application for all things web3. Furthermore, Vectre ensures that the true ownership of digital assets is maintained and appropriately indicated to prevent fraud. Vectre provides fertile soil for web3 communities to thrive by providing a platform by which community guidelines can be set through a proposal voting system, where verified members vote to shape the direction of their community.
