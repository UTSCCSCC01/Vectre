# Sprint 2 Planning Meeting
___
On the 13th of June, 2022, we held our sprint 2 Planning meeting on Discord with the goal of identifying the unfinished user stories, deciding which new user stories should be considered, indentifying the related tasks to the user stories, and distributing the tasks among the team members. All member of Vectre Labs were present during this meeting.

Through the planning meeting, we combined one unfinshed user story from sprint 1 and four new user stories to create a feature set that allow users to interact with contents on our platform. These features enable users to make comments on posts, repost posts that they want to share, showcase their NFTs, follow other users, and see notifications from other users' activities. We then break down the user stories to subtasks, evaluate the subtasks using plannig poker, and distribute them along with document responsibilities among our members.
