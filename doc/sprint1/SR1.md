- Nikhil
- Peter W.
- John

## Unfinished Tasks
- [VEC-4] As a user or moderator, I want to have a personal profile NFT dashboard so that I can share my NFTs and posts for others to see.
> "VEC-4 was planned to not be fully completed by the end of sprint 1. We only assigned ourselves the backend half (i.e. getting the NFTs from the wallet for the dashboard) as all of VEC-4 was too large a task to complete. VEC-4 will be finished in sprint 2"

## Practices To Continue Using 
- Frequent and productive standups allows everyone to know what is going on with all parts of the project
- Lots of resources being shared amongst the team, everyone was looking out for one another
- Going over the whole project (i.e. deliverables, features) together before handing in sprint 1


## New Practices To Use
- Creating necessary documentation on a rolling basis

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using
- Documenting parts of the project only at the end of the sprint

## Best Experiences 
- Exposure to new and industry-level technologies/practices
- Collaboratively working through the project, everyone has ownership over the whole project

## Worst Experiences 
- Dealing with crunch time to meet sprint goals while balancing other courses
- Difficult to learn niche APIs (i.e. working with Metamask wallet)
