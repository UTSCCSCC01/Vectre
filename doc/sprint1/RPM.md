# Release Planning Meeting


## Meeting Details

The Release Planning Meeting was held on May 30, 2022 and was participated by all members of the Vectre Labs group. During the meeting, group members discussed the features available in the application by the final presentation and how they will be implemented.

## Release Goal

For our release goal, we wish to build a social media application geared towards users with interests in NFTs. Users will be able to register accounts on the app using their MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet, show off their acquired NFTs on their profile in the form of a dashboard and participate in exclusive communities open to those with specific NFTs. 

Users will be able to register by simply connecting their MetaMask wallets [VEC-2] allowing them to set up their user profiles [VEC-3] and show off their acquired NFTS [VEC-4] or check their wallet's funds [VEC-15]. Users will also be able to deactivate their accounts if they choose to [VEC-18].

Just as in regular social media, users will be able to create their own posts [VEC-7] while also being able to interact [VEC-8] and sort [VEC-11] the posts on their personal feed from the people they follow [VEC-10]. Users will be able to receive notifications about interactions on posts [VEC-12] while also being able to save [VEC-20] or repost [VEC-9] others' content.

Connecting to one's MetaMask wallet allows users access to certain communities based on the NFTs they own [VEC-6]. In these communities, users will be able to interact with content from other members of the community. Users that don't have access to the full community will still be able to view them if the community allows it. Users of the app will be able to see trending communities [VEC-14] and be able to search them [VEC-13].

One of the main principals of the project is to keep the communities feature user-driven. This means that members of a community will have a say in its guidelines and major decisions [VEC-19]. Furthermore, community members will be able to elect their own moderators through a proposal voting system [VEC-16] allowing them to have access to administrative permissions in that community [VEC-17].
