# Sprint 3 Retrospective Meeting

## Participants In Meeting
- Prachyo
- Peter C.
- Henry
- Nikhil
- Peter W.
- John

## Unfinished Tasks
None!

## Practices To Continue Using 
- Having really thorough PR reviews from peers encouraging pair programming improving code quality
- Fast and frequent communication in Discord channels to ensure impediments are taken care of ASAP
## New Practices To Use
- Creating necessary documentation on a rolling basis

## Harmful Practices To Stop Using
- Avoid cramming near the end of the sprint; start harder tasks earlier since they produce the most amount of bugs later on

## Best Experiences 
- Learning redux for some of the members, being able to practice combining that with front end

## Worst Experiences 
- Balancing time for this project and midterms that were going on at the time
- Bad code testing plan
